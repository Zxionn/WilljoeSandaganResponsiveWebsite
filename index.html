        <p style="color:#000000; font-family:'SF Fedora Shadow';"> Raised on the mean streets of Zaun, Vi is a hotheaded, impulsive, and fearsome woman with very little respect for authority. She has always been a shrewd survivor,
             both from her youthful troublemaking topside and an unfairly long stint in Stillwater Hold.  </p>

        <p style="color:#0f0202; font-family:'SF Fedora Shadow';"> Jayce Talis is a brilliant inventor who, along with his friend Viktor, made the first great discoveries in the field of hextech. Celebrated across Piltover,
             he tries to live up to his reputation as "the Man of Progress," but often struggles with the expectations placed upon him.</p>

        <img id="Powder" src="./Jinx.png" alt="Worst">
        <p style="color:#0a0202; font-family:'SF Fedora Shadow';">Jinx, formerly known as Powder, is a criminal and antagonist in the game's universe. She has a dark past that includes the death of her family and the abandonment of her sister, Vi.
             Jinx's childhood trauma and guilt led her to adopt the identity of Jinx, and she copes with her emotions through violence and self-harm</p>
